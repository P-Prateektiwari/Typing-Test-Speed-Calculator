# Typing-Test-Speed-Calculator
# Project Description
The Typing Test Speed Calculator is a simple Python program that allows users to measure their typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and accuracy. The program provides a predefined sentence for the user to type as quickly and accurately as possible. It then calculates and displays the time taken, the number of words typed, the typing speed in WPM, and the accuracy of the typed text.

# Features
-> Typing Speed Measurement: Calculates the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on the user's input.  
-> Accuracy Calculation: Compares the user's input with the original text to determine typing accuracy as a percentage.  
-> Real-time Feedback: Provides immediate feedback on the user's typing performance, including time taken, WPM, and accuracy.

# Usage
->Run the program using the command.  
->A predefined text will be displayed in the console.  
->Press Enter to start the typing test.  
->Type the displayed text as quickly and accurately as possible.  
->Press Enter when you're done typing.  
->The program will display the results, including:  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     -Time Taken: The total time spent typing.  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       -Words Typed: The total number of words typed.  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      -Typing Speed: The speed of typing in words per minute (WPM).  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      -Accuracy: The accuracy of the typed text compared to the original text.  
                
# Example Output
Type the following text as fast as you can:  
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.  
Press Enter to start...  
Start typing here: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dg.  

# Results:
Time Taken: 8.24 seconds  
Words Typed: 8  
Typing Speed: 58.21 WPM  
Accuracy: 95.56%
